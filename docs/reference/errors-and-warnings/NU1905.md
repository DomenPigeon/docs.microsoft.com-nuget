# NuGet Warning NU1905

```text
warning NU1905: Audit source 'source name' did not provide any vulnerability data.
```

### Issue

At least one [`nuget.config` file](../nuget-config-file.md) defines an [`auditSource`](../nuget-config-file.md#auditsources), but the source does not provide any [vulnerability information](../../api/vulnerability-info.md).

If all of the sources defined in `auditSources` have this NU1905 warning, this means that [NuGet Audit](../../concepts/Auditing-Packages.md) will not run, as Audit does not have a vulnerabilities database in order to audit packages.

### Solution

If the source was added to `auditSources` instead of `packageSources` by accident, edit the `nuget.config` file in a text or XML editor, and move the `<add ... >` element to the `packageSources` section of the `nuget.config` file.

If the source previously provided vulnerability information and no longer does, contact the feed administrator.

If you would like to treat this warning as an error, to cause build failures when vulnerability checks could not be performed, you can set the `<WarningAsError>$(WarningAsError);NU1905</WarningAsError>` to your project file.
If you are using `TreatWarningsAsErrors` to cause all warnings to be treated as errors, you can add `<WarningsNotAsErrors>NU1905</WarningsNotAsErrors>` to your project file to prevent this warning from being treated as an error, or `<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);NU1905</NoWarn>` to suppress this warning message.

For more information, see [the documentation on auditing packages](../../concepts/Auditing-Packages.md).
